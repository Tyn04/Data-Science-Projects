* ### ML Projects
1. [Titanic_dataset_ML Project](https://github.com/Tyn04/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Titanic_dataset_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)

#### Objective Statement: 
The objective is to predict survival and investigate the influence of gender and ticket class on survival during the Titanic sinking in 1912.

#### Data Preprocessing and Analysis:
* Imported necessary Python libraries for data preprocessing and analysis.
* Loaded the dataset and previewed its contents.
* Conducted descriptive analysis to understand the distribution of data and checked for missing values.
* Handled missing values in relevant columns.
* Visualized survival rates based on age and passenger class.
  
#### Modeling and Prediction:
* Preprocessed the data further to prepare it for modeling.
* Trained a logistic regression model, a suitable algorithm for binary classification tasks like survival prediction.
* Used the logistic regression model to predict survival rates based on passenger class and gender.

2. [Supervised ML algorithms Classification - Social Network Ad](https://github.com/Tyn04/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Projects%20-%20Supervised_ML_algorithms_Classification-Social_Network_Ads.ipynb)

#### Objective Statement: 
The objective is to predict the influence of gender, age, and estimated Salary on purchases in a social media ad campaign

#### Data Preprocessing and Analysis:
* Imported necessary Python libraries for data preprocessing and analysis.
* Loaded the dataset and previewed its contents.
* Preprocessed the data and invoked on gender to transform 1 to male and 0 to female
* performed exploratory analysis.
* Engineered the age feature by categorizing the age according to generation, IGen, Millenials, GenX and Baby Boomers
* Then Engineered the Income feature by categorizing it as Low, Medium, and High
* Visualize no. of users based on gender category, another visual based on income category
* Also visualized based on those that purchased and those that did not
  
#### Modeling and Prediction:
* I first trained the model using non-engineered features with Purchased as the target while Gender, Age, and EstimatedSalary are attributes
* Fitted Naive Bayes algorithm to the non-engineered trained data
* Then predicted and evaluated the model performance 
* Then I repeated the same process for the Engineered features 
   
3. [Unsupervised ML clustering - Mall Customer dataset](https://github.com/Tyn04/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Project%20-%20unsupervised%20ML%20clustering%20Mall%20Customer%20dataset.ipynb)

#### Objective Statement: 
The owner of a mall wants to understand the customers who can easily be targeted for new stock of goods so that the insight can be given to the marketing team to plan accordingly.

#### Data Preprocessing and Analysis:
* Imported necessary Python libraries for data preprocessing and analysis.
* Loaded the dataset and previewed its contents.
* Performed exploratory analysis.
* Then performed a descriptive statistical analysis
* Visualized
  
#### Modeling and Prediction:
* Imported K-means from ScikitLearn and Used the elbow method to find the optimal number of cluster
* Fitted Naive Bayes algorithm to the non-engineered trained data
* Then visualized the clusters
