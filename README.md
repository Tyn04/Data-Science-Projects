1. [Titanic_dataset_ML Project](https://github.com/Tyn04/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Titanic_dataset_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)

#### Objective Statement: 
Thee objective is to predict survival and investigate the influence of gender and ticket class on survival during the Titanic sinking in 1912.

#### Data Preprocessing and Analysis:
* Imported necessary Python libraries for data preprocessing and analysis.
* Loaded the dataset and previewed its contents.
* Conducted descriptive analysis to understand the distribution of data and checked for missing values.
* Handled missing values in relevant columns.
* Visualized survival rates based on age and passenger class.
  
#### Modeling and Prediction:
* Preprocessed the data further to prepare it for modeling.
* Trained a logistic regression model, a suitable algorithm for binary classification tasks like survival prediction.
* Used the logistic regression model to predict survival rates based on passenger class and gender.
